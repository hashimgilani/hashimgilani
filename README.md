## 🧑‍💼 **About Me**
I am a Business Analytics graduate student with hands-on experience in data analysis, dashboard development, IT operations, and project coordination. My background combines analytical skills with leadership experience gained through IT support, technical reporting, and managing cross-functional projects.

In my current role as a Senior IT Assistant at Sacramento State, I lead junior staff, streamline workflows, and build Power BI dashboards that support operational and strategic decision-making. My project work includes analytics dashboards, SQL systems, machine learning models, NLP, and cloud-based (AWS) implementations.

I am passionate about solving problems with data, optimizing processes, and delivering insights that drive business outcomes.
